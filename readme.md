### Problem 1:
**Survival Analysis using Kaplan-Meier Estimator**

You are given the survival times (in weeks) and status (event occurrence or censored) of 19 patients. The data is presented below:

Survival times: 75, 166, 110, 144, 26, 118, 131, 14, 49, 153, 66, 36, 32, 11, 11, 15, 75, 85, 100
Status: 1 (event occurred) for the first 17 patients, and 0 (censored) for the last 2 patients.

Solution:
1. Create a data frame in R using the provided survival times and status.
2. Fit a Kaplan-Meier survival curve to the data.
3. Summarize the Kaplan-Meier fit and extract the survival probabilities.
4. Plot the Kaplan-Meier survival curve.
5. Interpret the survival probabilities and comment on the overall findings.
